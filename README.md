Classify Leetcode problems into patterns:

## Two Pointers
https://medium.com/outco/how-to-solve-sliding-window-problems-28d67601a66

### Fron/End Pointers

#### [LC] 11. Container With Most Water
https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/

#### [LC] 15. 3Sum
https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/

#### [LC] 16. 3Sum Closest
https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum-closest/  

Be careful on the conditions when should we move left pointer and when to move right pointer

#### [LC] 19. Remove Nth Node From End of List
https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/

Be careful on corner case, when n equals to size of list, and when n is only 1

#### [LC] 42. Trapping Rain Water
https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/

Move both front and end pointers when the corresponding wall is lower.

#### [LC] 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/

Goes through all the way from left to right to find min price at each day (store in new array), then goes through all the way from right to left to find max price at each day (store in new array), thne goes throw both new arrays together to get the max gap.

#### [LC] 344. Reverse String
https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/

#### [LC] 345. Reverse Vowels of a String
https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-vowels-of-a-string/

Be careful when using hashmap, only when map.get(key) != null means key exists.

## Tree
### Default
#### 94. Binary Tree Inorder Traversal
https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-inorder-traversal/

Remember:
Time complexity : O(n)  
The time complexity is O(n) because the recursive function is   
T(n) = 2 * T(n/2) + 1

Space complexity : 
The worst case space required is O(n), and in the average case it's O(logn) where n is number of nodes.

NOTE: can also use stack to do the inOrder traverse
#### [LC] 515. Find Largest Value in Each Tree Row
https://leetcode.com/problems/find-largest-value-in-each-tree-row/

Be careful when using ++variable, it would addup the variable itself! It's better to use variable + 1 most of the time;

#### [LC] 144. Binary Tree Preorder Traversal
https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-preorder-traversal/


#### 236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree
https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/

The trick is: if root is p or q, return root; if left or right is p or q, return left or right. The idea is that left or right can represent the top node of a subtree that contains p or q.

<algorithm>
if the root is p or q, just return root; 
If root is not p or q, check if left or right exsits p or q (check if it is null);
If left and right both exists, then current root is LCA, return current root;
If left or right exists, return left or right;

NOTE: the time complexity is O(n) since it traverse all nodes, but its space complexity is also O(n), since even though there is no heap space, the stack space would be O(n) if it is a skewed tree (like the height of the tree equals to number of nodes).


## Recursion
### Default
https://www.jianshu.com/p/1395fae8a1ae
How to think about recursion algorithm?
1. Find termination condition

#### [LC] 24. Swap Nodes in Pairs
https://leetcode.com/problems/swap-nodes-in-pairs/

Handle the first 2 nodes, call recursion function on 3rd ndoe, then point 1st node next to recursion result of 3rd node.  

#### [LC] 1137. N-th Tribonacci Number
https://leetcode.com/problems/n-th-tribonacci-number/

Be careful to store result that has already been calculated to save effort on re-calculation.

## Sort
### Default
#### [LintCode] 850. Employee Free Time

https://www.lintcode.com/problem/850/

Use custom comapritor, and be careful when union two intervals, set the end of the new interval to be the max one of original two intervals.

## HashMap
### Default
#### [LC] 1. Two Sum
Why "two sum" is not a two-pointers problem? To use two-pointers, we need to know when should we move the pointer, and for problem like "two sum", we cannot know it without sorting the array. But sorting would result in at least O(nlgn) time complexity. Considering by using hashmap we can already achieve O(n) time complexity, there is no need to use two-pointer here.


## LinkedList
### Default
#### [LC] 2. Add Two Numbers
https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/

Be careful on the corner case, like carryOver may result in a new node.


#### [LC] 109. Convert Sorted List to Binary Search Tree
https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-sorted-list-to-binary-search-tree/solution/

#### [LC] 24. Swap Nodes in Pairs
https://leetcode.com/problems/swap-nodes-in-pairs/

Simple version is to swithc node value, harder version is to switch nodes, remember to add preHead node, super version is to do it recursively.
